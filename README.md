Summary of PoE Features

The ExtremeXOS implementation of PoE supports the following features:


Configuration and control of the power distribution for PoE at the system, slot, and port levels

Real-time discovery and classification of IEEE 802.3af-compliant PDs and many legacy devices

Support for IEEE 802.3at-compliant PDs on PoE+ devices

Support for IEEE 802.3bt compliant PDs on PoE++ devices

Monitor and control of port PoE fault conditions including exceeding configured class limits and power limits and short-circuit detection

Support for configuring and monitoring PoE status at the system, slot, and port levels

Management of an over-subscribed power budget

Port LED control for indicating the link state

Support for hitless failover in a SummitStack with a master and backup node.

(Fast PoE) Ability to provide PoE power when the switch is powered on without waiting for boot up based on last saved PoE state (ExtremeSwitching X435; and X465 and 5520 (per port) series switches only).

(Perpetual PoE) Preserve PoE power delivery to devices during reboot (ExtremeSwitching X465 , X435, and 5520 series switches only).
