What are the types of IT asset management?

Generally speaking, IT assets fall into one or more of the following categories: physical, software, hardware, mobile, and the cloud. ITAM is designed to ensure successful deployment and ongoing support of IT assets. As such, it corresponds with these IT asset types.  


The three primary types of IT asset management are as follow:

Software: This type of ITAM is a bit more complex than the others, as it involves things like compliance requirements, licensing, shadow IT, and IoT. Software assets must be continuously monitored and reviewed, and the assets must be fluid enough to follow requirements 
and meet demands and a changing market.

Hardware: Physical hardware also plays a role in an organization's IT ecosystem. These physical assets include PCs, printers, copiers, laptops, mobile devices, servers, and any other hardware that is used for data management purposes within the company.

Cloud: ITAM tracks the cost and usage for cloud resources including software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Each of these are considered assets to be managed for cost and compliance within ITAM.
